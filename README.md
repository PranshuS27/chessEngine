# Chess Engine
My chess engine and bot 

## Introduction 
Basically just a simple chess engine and a bot to play with. It's probably rated around like 2000 or something based on similar bots, but I'm not more than 1200 so it's good enough for me. It predicts 3 moves ahead, more than that and it starts to take too long. 

## How It Works
It thinks 3 moves ahead (basically checking every valid move) and uses alpha beta pruning to ensure that it actually runs somewhat fast. It's not the most advanced bot, but I got inspired by Sebastian Lague's video on chess programming and my own love of chess. To put this in terms of another sort of engine I'm fond of, this is the LS of engines. Perhaps some day it'll be a 911 GT3 engine :^) 

## TO DO 

Update the graphics and make it look a little nicer. Maybe add customizable sprite sets too.
